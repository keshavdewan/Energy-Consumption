## Introduction
This dashboard uses Power BI to create an energy consumption dashboard. It addresses a company's challenge of monitoring energy consumption across buildings in various US cities from the year 2016 to 2019. Our approach involves utilizing Power BI to create dedicated pages for each energy type. Each page provides detailed insights into consumption patterns, anomalies, and cost-effectiveness metrics. The dashboard is divided into four sections: overview, water, electricity, and gas consumption insights.

## Challenge
The company faced the challenge of monitoring energy consumption across buildings in different countries. They needed a centralized platform to consolidate data from various sources and present it in a visually appealing and informative manner.
