## Introduction
This dashboard uses Power BI to create an energy consumption dashboard. It addresses a company's challenge of monitoring energy consumption across buildings in various US cities from the year 2016 to 2019. Our approach involves utilizing Power BI to create dedicated pages for each energy type. Each page provides detailed insights into consumption patterns, anomalies, and cost-effectiveness metrics. The dashboard is divided into four sections: overview, water, electricity, and gas consumption insights.

## Challenge
The company faced the challenge of monitoring energy consumption across buildings in different countries. They needed a centralized platform to consolidate data from various sources and present it in a visually appealing and informative manner.

## Solution
Use Power BI to create a comprehensive energy consumption dashboard. This dashboard provides an overview of the company's energy consumption across all buildings, as well as detailed insights into each energy type.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is divided into four sections:

-  Overview: This section provides a high-level overview of the company's energy consumption, including total consumption, consumption by cities, and consumption by energy type.
-  Water: This section provides detailed insights into water cost and consumption, including total cost and consumption by building and by month.
-  Electricity: This section provides detailed insights into electricity cost and consumption, including total cost and consumption by building and by month.
-  Gas: This section provides detailed insights into gas cost and consumption, including total cost and consumption by building and by month.

## Key Features
The dashboard includes a number of key features, including:

-  Interactive visualizations: The dashboard includes a variety of interactive visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and tables. This allows to explore the data in different ways and to drill down to see more detailed information.
-  Filters: The dashboard includes a number of filters to filter the data by building, energy type, month, or other criteria.
-  Drill-down functionality: The dashboard includes drill-down functionality, which allows to drill down into the data to see more detailed information.
-  Customizable dashboards: The dashboard is customizable, so we can add or remove features to meet our specific needs.


## Benefits
